            An Operating System performs all the basic tasks like managing files, processes, and memory. Thus the
            operating system acts as the manager of all the resources, i.e., a resource manager. Thus, the operating
            system becomes an interface between the user and the machine. It is one of the most required software that
            is present in the device. The Operating System is a type of software that works as an interface between the
            system program and the hardware. There are several types of Operating Systems in which many are mentioned
            below. Let’s have a look at them.

            An OS manages device communication via its respective drivers. It performs the following activities for
            device management. Keeps track of all devices connected to the system. designates a program responsible for
            every device known as the Input/Output controller. Decide which process gets access to a certain device and
            for how long. Allocates devices effectively and efficiently. Deallocates devices when they are no longer
            required. There are various input and output devices. An OS controls the working of these input-output
            devices. It receives the requests from these devices, performs a specific task, and communicates back to the
            requesting process.

            A file system is organized into directories for efficient or easy navigation and usage. These directories
            may contain other directories and other files. An Operating System carries out the following file management
            activities. It keeps track of where information is stored, user access settings, the status of every file,
            and more. These facilities are collectively known as the file system. An OS keeps track of information
            regarding the creation, deletion, transfer, copy, and storage of files in an organized way. It also
            maintains the integrity of the data stored in these files, including the file directory structure, by
            protecting against unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a multi-programming environment, the OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor
            and how much processing time each process has. This function of OS is called Process Scheduling. An
            Operating System performs the following activities for Processor Management.

            Almost all operating systems have a user interface (UI). This interface can take several forms. One is a
            command-line interface (CLI), which uses text commands and a method for entering them (say, a keyboard for
            typing in commands in a specific format with specific options). Another is a batch interface, in which
            commands and directives to control those commands are entered into files, and those files are executed. Most
            commonly, a graphical user interface (GUI) is used. The interface is a window system with a pointing device
            to direct I/O, choose from menus, and make selections and a keyboard to enter text.

            A network is a collection of two or more devices connected by communication links so that they can
            communicate with each other and share resources and information. Some examples of networks are email,
            instant messaging, banking, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Device:
            Device means any entity connected to a network and capable of sharing and/or receiving data. It includes
            devices such as PCs, printers, mobile phones, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Communication link:
            A communication channel that connects two devices in a network. The connection can be physical through
            cables like copper wire, optical fiber or can be wireless like the use of radio waves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Point-to-Point:
            A dedicated communication channel or link connects 2 devices. The two connected devices use the full
            capacity of the channel as no other devices are connected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multipoint (Broadcast):
            More than two devices share a single link. Channel capacity is shared between connected devices.

            Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users’ data while considering
            appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS
            accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific
            data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.

            A database is an organised collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in
            a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the
            data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database
            system, often shortened to just a database.
        </p>

            A Relational Database Management system (RDBMS) is a database management system that is based on the
            relational model. It has the following major components: Table, Record/Tuple/Row, Field, and
            Column/Attribute. Examples of the most popular RDBMS are MYSQL, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server
            database.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure the consistency of the database, certain properties are followed by all the
            transactions occurring in the system.
            These properties are called ACID Properties of a transaction.

            Scaling alters the size of a system. In the scaling process, we either compress or expand the system to meet
            the expected needs. The scaling operation can be achieved by adding resources to meet the smaller
            expectation in the current system, or by adding a new system in the existing one, or both.
